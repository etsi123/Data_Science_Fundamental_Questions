# Probability Fundamental Questions

<font size="20">**1. Roll a dice 3 times. What is the probability of getting 2 6's in a row?**</font>

Easiest way to solve this problem is to count the total number of ways to get 2 6's in a row, count the total number of 3 roll outcomes, and then divide the two. 

How many ways to get 2 6's in a row? 
	1. Roll 1 is a 6, Roll 2 is a 6, Roll 3 is anything (6)
	2. Roll 2 is a 6, Roll 3 is a 6, Roll 1 is anything (6)
	3. We counted rolling a 6 three consecutive times in both (1) and (2), so we must subtract 1. 

Therefore, answer is (6 + 6 - 1) / (6^3) = 11/216.
